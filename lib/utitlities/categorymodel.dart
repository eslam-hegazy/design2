Place a large roasting pan or Dutch oven over medium-high flame and coat with the remaining olive oil. Put the brisket in the roasting pan and sear to form a nice brown crust on both sides.

With a fragrant tomato coconut sauce with a fresh hit of lime, this is such a different exotic way to serve up fish that is off the charts delicious – yet simple to make.When I think of Brazilian food, I immediately have visions of grilled meat. Specifically, Churrasco. Serious quantities of grilled meat on giant skewers with the waiters walking from table to table, slicing the meat straight from the skewer onto my plate.Carnivore heaven.Because of the strong association of Brazilian food with Churrasco (and also because I don’t have a giant grill with a rotisserie) I thought sharing this traditional Brazilian fish stew would be nice for something a bit different!",

They are buttery and earthy in flavor, and full of fiber.I love them because, even though they are low in fat, they add a very satisfying creaminess to dishes.Sea Bass, a rich buttery fish pairs exceptionally well with the stew, and although it can be quite pricey, it’s worth the splurge. Other fish options include Alaskan cod, escolar, halibut, black cod or even scallops.The fish is simply seasoned – with a bit of salt and pepper, then seared in olive oilif using dried cannellini beans, remember to soak them in a bowl of ample water the night before, which will greatly improve their digestibly, and lessen their cooking time.

Because first, it's a great song, and second, aguanile rhymes with aguachile. My hope is that, if you're anything like me, you will forever have this song play in your head whenever you think of aguachile, with the word aguachile in place of the original one.So now that we have a soundtrack, let's get back to aguachile. I was in Mexico a couple weeks ago, mostly in Mexico City with one day in Puebla and a few days in Tulum for a wedding, and among the many great things I ate there were two strikingly different versions of aguachile, a type of Mexican ceviche.   The first was at chef Enrique Olvera's great restaurant Pujol, and it is by far the most unorthodox version one is likely to see. It's also very pretty.   Aguachile could be translated as “chile water” and it gives you a huge hint on the presentation of this recipe.   It’s lime marinated shrimp in a watery sauce of peppers/chile. It’s accompanied by cucumber, purple onions, and avocado. It resembles a lot a Peruvian shrimp ceviche but the technique -and of course flavor- is different. This is more refreshing and, in Mexico, aguachile is often consumed at the beach.",

I sauté the shrimp in butter; then stir in fresh basil, garlic, chopped tomatoes and add a little bit of white wine; which I then serve over linguine that has been tossed in olive oil and grated Pecorino Romano cheese.It’s not the healthiest meal which is why I don’t make it very often, but everything in moderation, right?

It’s not just because I think Starbucks employees shouldn’t have to see me first thing in the morning, or that I shouldn’t be trusted to drive that early. Or, even that I’m going to bring my crazy, barking dog in the car with me. While all of these things are true, I make lattes at home because I’m lazy. I’m a lazy resting-bitch-face driver, often wearing glasses with a 2-year old prescription in the morning. Also, my dog is a jerk to strangers. Baristas want to spit in the lattes of people like me. So, I will always make lattes at home.Yeah, making a from-scratch latte every morning takes a few minutes of your time. But I’ve found that in those quiet moments, while the dog is chomping on his food, and my husband is styling that gorgeous head of hair of his, I like doing something for myself. Brewing tea or coffee, stirring spices and streaming in molasses isn’t too hard, really. I’m half-asleep and blind in the morning, remember?I hope you’re enjoying gingerbread week here on Dessert for Two. Do you have any requests for gingerbread flavored things?

  categorymodel("Roasted garlic can take a recipe from 0 to 100 real quick. Unlike raw cloves, there's no bite in roasted garlic at all. Insanely creamy and with a rich umami flavor that will instantly upgrade any meal, you can add roasted garlic to almost anything savory — fall soups, mashed potatoes, salad dressings, and hummus. Or you can simply spread some on toast. After a little less than an hour, it will be soft like butter.Trust us. You'll know the garlic is ready when your kitchen smells outrageously and maddeningly good, and when you can very easily pierce a clove with a knife. When you reach this point, it's important to let the garlic cool for a bit, then simply use your fingers to squeeze the bottom of the cloves out of the skin. Don't try to scoop them out or you'll risk leaving behind some amazing garlic.If you're as obsessed with the flavor as we are, it's probably a good idea to roast a few heads and freeze the extras. (Seriously, this is a game changer.) Refrigerated roasted garlic will last in the fridge for a couple of weeks. Frozen, it'll stay good for a few months. When roasting more than one head of garlic, there's no need to create individual foil packs; they can all roast together.Short on time? Separate the cloves (leaving the skins in tact) and wrap them in foil. You'll cut back on a considerable amount of time and the results will be equally satisfying.",

These healthy Breakfast Power Cookies (that also happen to be vegan) are the perfect solution. Filled with nuts, seeds, dried fruit, coconut and whole grain oats, these are hearty, nourishing, and out-of-control delicious!Oats have to be my favourite wholegrain, hands down.  They are super versatile and incredibly healthy; Quaker oats are nothing but 100% whole grain and contain beta glucan.  Beta gluten is a soluble fibre that helps lower cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease.  In addition, fibre helps stabilize blood sugar to help prevent the spikes and dips that can occur after eating that impacts energy levels. Oats are also a nutrient-rich source of energy: an ideal base for these Breakfast Power Cookies that I created in partnership with Quaker Oats. Because who doesn’t need more energy, right?!We have a number of family members who need to avoid gluten, so I’m always on the lookout for ways to manipulate recipes to make them gluten free.  The good news here is that you can make these gluten free by using the Gluten Free Quaker Oats and gluten free variations of the other ingredients.You can use any fruit you want for the dried fruit – we used a combination of dried apricots, raisins and raisins.  If you like a less sweet cookie opt for the lower amount of maple syrup – either way they weren’t overly sweet (I preferred them with the 3/4 cup of maple syrup)!I’ve also been asked about substitutions.  You can substitute any nut or seed butter for the almond butter (try peanut butter or even tahini – and sub more seeds for the nuts – to make them nut free and totally school friendly!).  You can also substitute regular flour (preferably whole wheat or spelt but all-purpose should work) for the oat flour.  Of course at that point they will not be gluten free.  Lastly you can easily substitute melted butter or vegan butter for the coconut oil if preferred.These soft cookies freeze beautifully (if they don’t disappear first!).  I’ve been making double batches of them to freeze for a quick bite on the go and the kids LOVE them!  In fact, I made a batch of them to take on our road trip to Tofino and they were a lifesaver!",

These healthy Breakfast Power Cookies (that also happen to be vegan) are the perfect solution. Filled with nuts, seeds, dried fruit, coconut and whole grain oats, these are hearty, nourishing, and out-of-control delicious!Oats have to be my favourite wholegrain, hands down.  They are super versatile and incredibly healthy; Quaker oats are nothing but 100% whole grain and contain beta glucan.  Beta gluten is a soluble fibre that helps lower cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease.  In addition, fibre helps stabilize blood sugar to help prevent the spikes and dips that can occur after eating that impacts energy levels. Oats are also a nutrient-rich source of energy: an ideal base for these Breakfast Power Cookies that I created in partnership with Quaker Oats. Because who doesn’t need more energy, right?!We have a number of family members who need to avoid gluten, so I’m always on the lookout for ways to manipulate recipes to make them gluten free.  The good news here is that you can make these gluten free by using the Gluten Free Quaker Oats and gluten free variations of the other ingredients.You can use any fruit you want for the dried fruit – we used a combination of dried apricots, raisins and raisins.  If you like a less sweet cookie opt for the lower amount of maple syrup – either way they weren’t overly sweet (I preferred them with the 3/4 cup of maple syrup)!I’ve also been asked about substitutions.  You can substitute any nut or seed butter for the almond butter (try peanut butter or even tahini – and sub more seeds for the nuts – to make them nut free and totally school friendly!).  You can also substitute regular flour (preferably whole wheat or spelt but all-purpose should work) for the oat flour.  Of course at that point they will not be gluten free.  Lastly you can easily substitute melted butter or vegan butter for the coconut oil if preferred.These soft cookies freeze beautifully (if they don’t disappear first!).  I’ve been making double batches of them to freeze for a quick bite on the go and the kids LOVE them!  In fact, I made a batch of them to take on our road trip to Tofino and they were a lifesaver!",
